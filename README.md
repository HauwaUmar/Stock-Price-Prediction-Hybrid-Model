# Stock-Price-Prediction-Hybrid-Model

This is a project that aims to build a hybrid model for predicting stock prices using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Prophet. The model uses historical stock price data to make predictions about future stock prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, and Prophet libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chenzhang0329/StockPrice-Hybrid-Model-.git`
2. Install the required packages
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Final_Assignment_Main_Good_copy (1).ipynb` in your IDE.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Final_Assignment_Main_Good_copy (1).ipynb` in your IDE.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and create the Prophet model.
3. Use the trained models to make predictions about future stock prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for a particular company.

## Model

The hybrid model used in this project combines the strengths of both LSTM and Prophet models. LSTM is a type of neural network that can analyze sequential data, while Prophet is a time-series forecasting model developed by Facebook.

The LSTM model is used to analyze the historical stock price data and extract important features. These features are then used as inputs to the Prophet model, which makes predictions about future stock prices.

## Evaluation

The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The evaluation can be found in the notebook.
